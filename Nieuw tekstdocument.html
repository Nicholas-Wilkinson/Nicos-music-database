<h1> HISTORY OF SPREACOMBE </h1>



</div> <!-- end of #header -->




<div id="main">

Spreacombe was first mentioned in the <a href="spreacombe-domesday.html">Domesday Book</a>. Through much of the Medieval and Early Modern period it was owned by the <a href="spreacombe-arundells.html">Arundell family</a>.
By the end of the eighteenth century it was in the hands of the <a href="spreacombe-lucas.html">Lucas family</a>. The <a href="spreacombe-riddell.html">Riddells</a> took it over in the early nineteenth century.
It was Robert Andrew Riddell who built the current Manor House. The <a href="spreacombe-19C-inhabitants.html">nineteenth-century census returns</a> also provide information about the 
farmers and farm workers in the valley. At the end of the nineteenth century Spreacombe was briefly owned by <a href="spreacombe-symons.html">Charles Symons</a>. He sold it
 on to <a href="spreacombe-style.html">Major Style</a>. In the 1920s it was sold to <a href="spreacombe-cecil.html">Lady Cecil and Arthur Barker</a>. On Arthur Barker's death it was sold to Haywoods and in 1963 the current 
family, the Dennisses, took it over.
